# Lab 8 - Starter
Check your understanding
1. You would fit your automated tests in your Recipe project in github actions. Whenever code is pushed or pull requested, you can only complete the push/pull request if you github actions' automated tests passes.

2. No

3. No I would not use unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application due to the fact that there is most likely multiple parts that make up the message feature and testing them individually won't mean the whole thing works together.

4. Yes I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature, because it most likely only is made up from one function. Passing a string into a function that tests its length, and depending the length, returns a boolean.
